## Simulation and Serious Games

In this website, you will find documentation of some of my **Simulation and Serious Games projects 

### Team Game Prototype Overview


```markdown
The point of the application is to sort team members and create the "perfect" team based on skills and values. 

The overview of our  application is to follow a specific path for individual users to follow based on their choices. 
The users start by seeings two doors. On top of these doors, there are blocks that contain text. 
Each text represents a specific skill in which the user has to decide which one is more important. 
As soon as they enter the door they believe is under the most important skill, they are given more paths to take. 
It could be scenarios or skills. After entering more doors, they are welcomed with other team members who share the same values. 
Since this is a porotype, it lacks the servers needed to connect other users and see how well this application works. 
Furthermore, this is not taking in consideration **specific** reasons on why a team should be assembled as such. 
For example, maybe a team will get stuck with programmers for a game that requires more than just on job description.
There needs to be a way to sort teams not just by skills, but in terms of what the team actually needs to finish the job. 
What it does strongly is allow players to visually see what paths they take. 
This evolved from the mindset of the classic job application. 
Rather, it is a overglorified version of a job applcation's questionaire. 
In terms of our prototype, I am pretty sure it works well.

### Memory Game

```markdown

The point of this project is to create a simple way for students to memorize terms used in our class for a test.
Our projected initially started as a simple tabletop game. However, the game slowly started to get a little complicated. 
In turn, there was some value loss at the memory portion of the game. Our memory game basically went full RPG.
Players used customization to create a specific character. Theses skills are play-on-words for the terms. 
Once the player decides what skils to use, they are required to go through specific scenarios and dialogue. 
Again, these dialogues contain the terms used in class, including examples and context clues. It worked well for an RPG.
However, as a memory game, it did flop a bit. Still, it was a good experience as the game has so much potential.
With a little work on the art and a clear understanding of the directions, the game could evolve a lot more.
